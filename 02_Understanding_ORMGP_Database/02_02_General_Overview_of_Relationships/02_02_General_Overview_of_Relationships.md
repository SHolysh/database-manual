## Section 2.2 General Overview of Relationships

The following tables provide the general relationship between the 'data'
tables (i.e. those prepended with a 'D_') and the 'reference' tables (also
known as the 'look-up' tables; prepended with a 'R_') within the database
(Table 2.2.1).  Additional 'web' tables (prepended with a 'W_') contain a weekly summary of information as found within the database by location.  These are used as the source for all web-based mapping.

Note that, for the second table (Table 2.2.2), any listed key in the second 'Key' column implies a change in the name of the field between the related tables.
