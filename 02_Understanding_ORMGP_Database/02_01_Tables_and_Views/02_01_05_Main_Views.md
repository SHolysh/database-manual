#### V_CON_\* (Consultant Views)

These views were prepared to provide a 'cutout' of information from the database that can be provided to consultants working in a specific geographic area of a partner agencies jurisdiction.  Rather than providing the entire database to a consultant, specific locations in the project area can be flagged by making use, for example, of the SYS_TEMP_1 or SYS_TEMP_2 fields (though there are alternative methods).  Once the locations have been flagged using a specific, searchable, value (possibly created spatially through, for example, Viewlog or a GIS) then the V_CON_* views can be filtered to extract the locations (and their information) required by the consultant.  See also Appendix J.3 for an (internal) Microsoft SQL Server solution.  Note that these views honour the settings in LOC_CONFIDENTIALITY_CODE and INT_CONFIENTIALITY_CODE.

The views contain a subset of available data fields as well as introducing summary fields (especially with regard to temporal data) of available information found at each location.  All look-up codes have been translated to their named equivalents.  

#### V_CON_DOCUMENT

This view simplifies the listing of the documents residing within the ORMGP report library.  Only a certain number of fields from the D_LOCATION and D_DOCUMENT tables are included here.  Consultants may then wish to request specific report files as a follow up action.  The data returned here is meant to be a subset of V_GEN_DOCUMENT.

#### V_CON_GENERAL

This view summarizes the main location information from a number of tables including location names, coordinates, borehole depth, ground surface elevation, etc?  It also includes

* The number of water level readings associated with the/any screens
* The number of soil samples from the borehole
* The number of pumping measurements taken
* The number of water quality readings taken
* The number of geologic layers present
* The number of screens present

#### V_CON_GEOLOGY

This view includes the top- and bottom-elevations of the geologic units associated with a location.  In addition, the material codes have converted to their text descriptions.  The data returned here is meant to be a subset of V_GEN_GEOLOGY.

#### V_CON_HYDROGEOLOGY

This view includes the screen information by location (multiple screens at a location would be represented across multiple records).  Any associated pumping and water level data (including the date for the former and the date range for the latter) are indicated.  The formation assigned to the screen (if identified) is shown.  A well flowing tag (FLOWING) is also returned.  The data returned here is meant to be a subset of V_GEN_HYDROGEOLOGY.

#### V_CON_PICK

This view returns information from the PICKS table - additions including the location name and study as well as the borehole depth.  The data returned here is meant to be a subset of V_GEN_PICK.

#### V_CON_PTTW

This view returns information from the D_LOCATION and D_PTTW tables.  The data returned here is meant to be a subset of V_GEN_PTTW.

#### V_CON_WATER_LEVEL_AVG_DAILY

This view returns the daily calculated average water level as well as associated information (e.g. reference point, ground elevation, screen depths, etc?).

#### V_GEN_\* (General Views)

The base views provided in the database, and discussed here, are for the partner agencies to readily access information from the multitude of tables that have been described, above.  The purpose of the views is to pull or query out key information from the database and present it in an easy to understand manner.  The V_GEN_* views are preferentially to be used when accessing the database (by non-expert users).  Each view contains basic information from a particular location (e.g. LOC_ID, LOC_NAME, LOC_NAME_ALT1, LOC_COORD_EASTING, LOC_COORD_NORTHING, etc...) as well as information related to the particular view name (e.g. in addition to the previously mentioned fields, the V_GEN_GEOLOGY view contains BH_GND_ELEV, BH_TOP_ELEV, BH_BOTTOM_ELEV, etc...).  In many cases, the original field names have been modified to for ease of use or to more adequately describe the data contained within.

#### V_GEN

This is the base view used by many other V_GEN_* views.  Only basic information is available here (e.g. name, coordinates, purpose, etc?).

#### V_GEN_BOREHOLE

This view contains basic borehole information, combining data from D_LOCATION and D_BOREHOLE (in which the location must be present) as well as some screen information (if available).

#### V_GEN_BOREHOLE_BEDROCK

This view uses V_GEN_BOREHOLE as a base only extracting those locations that encounter bedrock.  This is dependent upon the BH_BEDROCK_ELEV being populated (in D_BOREHOLE; refer to Appendix G with regards to how this is accomplished).

#### V_GEN_BOREHOLE_OUTCROP

This view uses V_GEN_BOREHOLE as a base only extracting those locations that are identified as outcrop (i.e. LOC_TYPE_CODE '11').

#### V_GEN_DOCUMENT

This view extracts document (i.e. LOC_TYPE_CODE '25') information from the D_LOCATION and D_DOCUMENT tables.  Only basic information such as the title and folder number (as found within the ORMGP report library) and the author and client agencies are included.

#### V_GEN_DOCUMENT_ASSOCIATION

This view extracts all locations (usually boreholes) associated with a particular document.  This information is accessed from the D_DOCUMENT_ASSOCIATION table.

#### V_GEN_DOCUMENT_BIBLIOGRAPHY

This view assembles a bibliographic reference for each document in D_DOCUMENT.  The format handles reports, journal articles and texts appropriately.

#### V_GEN_FIELD

This view extracts all field data (i.e. from D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2) by interval and location.  Parameter codes are converted to their text description.

#### V_GEN_FIELD_CLIMATE

This view returns the total number of readings by reading group code (see R_RD_NAME_CODE and R_READING_GROUP_CODE) as found in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1B and D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_2.  The source for the particular record (i.e. from which of the temporal tables) is indicated by a '(DIT1)' or '(DIT2)' being appended to the reading group name.  Note that empty reading groups will not be indicated.  This view is used to (partially) populate D_VERSION_STATUS on a semi-regular basis.

This view should also be used as a quality check with regard to the appropriateness of data records residing in a particular temporal table (e.g. water level records should not occur in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_1A/1B).

#### V_SUM_SCREEN_COUNTS

This view returns the number of screens by screen type present in the database.  Note that D_INTERVAL_MONITOR is used to delimit the intervals instead of reliance upon the INT_TYPE_CODE.

#### V_SUM_STATION_CLIMATE_PRECIP

This view returns the total precipitation (and record count) by year for each interval.  Note that only those records with an RD_NAME_CODE of '551' (i.e. 'Precipitation - Daily Total') will be included.  The source data is found in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_3.

#### V_SUM_STATION_CLIMATE_RAINFALL

This view returns the total rainfall (and record count) by year for each interval.  Note that only those records with an RD_NAME_CODE of '549' (i.e. 'Rainfall (Daily Total)') will be included.  The source data is found in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_3.

#### V_SUM_STATION_CLIMATE_SNOWFALL

This view returns the total snowfall (and record count) by year for each interval.  Note that only those records with an RD_NAME_CODE of '550' (i.e. 'Snowfall (Daily Total)') will be included.  The source data is found in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_3.

#### V_SUM_STATION_CLIMATE_TEMP

This returns the minimum, maximum and average temperature (as well as the record count) by year for each interval.  Note that only those records with an RD_NAME_CODE of '548' (i.e. 'Temperature (Air) - Daily Mean') will be included.  The source data is found in D_INTERVAL_TEMPORAL_3.

#### V_SUM_SURFACE_WATER_FIELD

This view returns the yearly minimum, maximum and record count values for LOC_TYPE_CODE '6' (i.e. 'Surface Water') and the interval types (INT_TYPE_CODE)

    - Surface Water Flow Gauge ('4')
    - Surface Water Spot Flow ('10')
    - Surface Water Spot Stage Elevation ('14')

Note that this does not include the any of the calculated baseflow RD_NAME_CODE's (i.e. codes '1002' through '1013').  If multiple UNIT_CODE's occur in the database, these will appear as multiple rows.

V_VL_BOREHOLES

This view returns the information necessary for Viewlog to plot and interact with boreholes when working with cross-sections.

V_VL_GEO_GSC

This view returns the information necessary or Viewlog to plot and interact with boreholes when working with cross-sections.  In particular, the GSC interpreted description of the geologic layer material (as well as its top and bottom elevations) are returned.  This description is converted to uppercase.

V_VL_GEO_MAT123

This view returns the information necessary for Viewlog to plot and interact with boreholes when working with cross-sections.  This is similar to V_VL_GEOLOGY with the exception that the GSC description is included (if available).  Additional fields are included from D_GEOLOGY_LAYER.

V_VL_GEOLOGY

This view returns the information necessary for Viewlog to plot and interact with boreholes when working with cross-sections.  In particular, the three possible materials for each geologic layer as well as their top and bottom elevations are returned.  The descriptive text is converted to uppercase.  

V_VL_HEADER_LOG

This view returns the information necessary for Viewlog to plot and interact with boreholes.  In particular, this view is used to populate a single borehole page for inclusion in reports.

V_VL_HEADER_SCREEN

This view returns the information necessary for Viewlog to plot and interact with boreholes when working with cross-sections.  In particular, top and bottom elevations for screens are returned for applicable locations; the TEXT field (name) must be populated with 'SCREEN'.
